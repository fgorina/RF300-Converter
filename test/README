RF300 Frequency to PWM

This adevice reads a signal from pin IN_GPIO (13), detects
it's frequency and converts it to an angle that may be positive
or negative.

Frequency for angle 0 is defined in variable center_f in hz
Step in Hz/degree is defined in hz_degree
Angle range is +/- angle_range

Angle value is converted to a duty cycle with 

    0 -> -angle_range
    1024 -> +angle_range

and used for a pwm at pin v_PWM (5)

If device is Heltec WiFiKit 32 data of frequency and angle is hown in the OLED Screen.

OLED Screen is turned off if not activaded for 60s

Pin TOUCH_GPIO (12) is used as a capacitive touch to enable the screen for 60s

There is code to connect to a SignalK Server and update steering.rudderAngle but
is disconnected as pypilot does it itself.

Esternal circuits necessary for interfacing the RF300 to the PyPilot motor controller is shown in the acompanying circuit.

Depending at how good is the signal, just a voltage follower after a high pass filter is enough. 

PWM output is uset to drive a transistor to use the motor controller voltages and filtered with a secon pass low pass filter.
